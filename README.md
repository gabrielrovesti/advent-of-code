# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repo contains my solutions to the annual Advent of Code challenge.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It's created by Eric Wastl and has been running since 2015. Each year, starting from December 1st and ending on December 25th, a programming puzzle is released each day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year and day. Each year has its own directory, and within each year's directory, there are subdirectories for each day's challenge. For example:

```
â””â”€â”€ 2023
    â”œâ”€â”€ day01
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.py
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part2.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ day02
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.py
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part2.py
    ...
```

- `input.txt`: This file contains the puzzle input for the day's challenge.
- `solver.py`: This script solves the current day's challenge.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the directory for the specific day and run the Python script for the part you want to solve. For example:

```bash
cd 2023/day01
python part1.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine to run the scripts.
